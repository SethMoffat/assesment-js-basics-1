// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Analysis of Requirements !
// Design
// Implementation
// Maintain
// Planning !
// Testing & Integration


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = "By analyzing the end goal, deduce what software specifications will be necessary for the completion of the project"
const design = "Before writing any code develope a layout of exactly how you want your software to look and function"
const implementation = "Start developing the features of your program"
const testingAndIntegration = "After completion make trial runs with your program to ensure it functions as it did in the designs"
const maintain = "Make sure that your code can continue running in the future"
